# 👋 Hi, I'm a Full-Stack Developer & Cloud-Native Platform Engineer

I’m a Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on **cloud-native platforms, DevOps, and platform engineering**.  
My background in application development allows me to design infrastructure and CI/CD systems that are **practical, scalable, and developer-friendly**.

I specialize in building **internal developer platforms**, automating delivery pipelines, and running **production-grade Kubernetes infrastructure**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- Design and build **cloud-native platforms** for backend teams  
- Create **CI/CD pipelines as reusable platforms**, not one-off scripts  
- Operate and scale **Kubernetes-based microservice environments**  
- Automate infrastructure using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
- Improve **developer experience** by reducing cognitive load and manual work  

My goal is to make **delivery fast for developers** and **systems reliable in production**.

## 🚀 Flagship Project

### Cloud-Native Developer Platform

A self-service developer platform that standardizes CI/CD workflows, Kubernetes deployments, and observability for microservices.

**Key Features**
- Opinionated service templates for fast onboarding  
- Automated CI/CD pipelines with environment promotion  
- Kubernetes-based runtime with resource governance  
- Built-in observability using Prometheus and Grafana  

**What This Demonstrates**
- Platform engineering mindset  
- Production-ready Kubernetes design  
- CI/CD built as a platform, not per-project tooling  
- Strong focus on reliability and developer experience

## 🧩 Platform Design Philosophy

I approach DevOps as a **product built for developers**, guided by these principles:

- Reduce cognitive load for development teams  
- Standardize workflows without blocking flexibility  
- Favor automation over manual processes  
- Treat CI/CD and infrastructure as long-term platforms  

I value **clear abstractions**, **well-documented decisions**, and systems that scale with team growth.

## 🛠️ Core Tech Stack

**Platform & Runtime**
- Kubernetes
- Docker

**CI/CD & Automation**
- GitHub Actions
- Helm

**Infrastructure**
- Terraform

**Cloud**
- AWS
- GCP

**Observability**
- Prometheus
- Grafana

I prioritize **depth and production experience** over long tool lists.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I started as a **full-stack developer** and transitioned into DevOps and platform engineering.  
This background helps me bridge the gap between **application development and operations**, building platforms that developers actually enjoy using.

I’m especially interested in:
- Platform engineering
- Kubernetes in production
- Improving developer experience through automation
