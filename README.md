# 👋 Hi, I'm a Full-Stack Developer & Cloud-Native Platform Engineer

I’m a Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on **cloud-native platforms, DevOps, and platform engineering**.  
My background in application development allows me to design infrastructure and CI/CD systems that are **practical, scalable, and developer-friendly**.

I specialize in building **internal developer platforms**, automating delivery pipelines, and running **production-grade Kubernetes infrastructure**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- Design and build **cloud-native platforms** for backend teams  
- Create **CI/CD pipelines as reusable platforms**, not one-off scripts  
- Operate and scale **Kubernetes-based microservice environments**  
- Automate infrastructure using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
- Improve **developer experience** by reducing cognitive load and manual work  

My goal is to make **delivery fast for developers** and **systems reliable in production**.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I started as a **full-stack developer** and transitioned into DevOps and platform engineering.  
This background helps me bridge the gap between **application development and operations**, building platforms that developers actually enjoy using.

I’m especially interested in:
- Platform engineering
- Kubernetes in production
- Improving developer experience through automation
